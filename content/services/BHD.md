abstract: "BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHD-RAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant image-description pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis."
