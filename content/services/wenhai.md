abstract: "Wenhai, a data driven eddy-resolving global ocean forecast system (GOFS), by training a deep neural network (DNN). The bulk formulae on momentum, heat, and freshwater fluxes are incorporated into the DNN to improve the representation of air-sea interactions. Ocean dynamics is exploited in the DNN architecture design to preserve ocean mesoscale eddy variability. WenHai outperforms a state-of-the art eddy-resolving numerical GOFS and AI-based GOFS for the temperature profile, salinity profile, sea surface temperature, sea level anomaly, and near surface current forecasts led by 1 day to at least 10 days."
